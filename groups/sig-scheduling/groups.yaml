  # Each group here represents privileged access to a staging project,

  #
  # k8s-infra owners for sig-owned subprojects

  # Each group here represents highly privileged access to kubernetes project

  # RBAC groups:
  # - grant access to the `namespace-user` role for a single namespace on the `aaa` cluster
  # - must have WhoCanViewMemberShip: "ALL_MEMBERS_CAN_VIEW"
  # - must be members of gke-security-groups@kubernetes.io
